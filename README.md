# EDGE-Microbiome-Project-2021
The Extreme Drought in Grasslands Experiment (EDGE) imposed chronic drought for four years (2014-2017). Rainout shelters were used to impose drought by reducing each precipitation event by 66% for entire growing season. This current project is now looking at how the soil microbiome has changed (or not) since the experiment ended. There are 4 study sites included in this study (listed below). The main focus of this study is to gain insight into the response of the soil microbiome during the recovery period after drought. The methods used in this study are similar to [Ocho-Hueso et al 2018[(https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14113)
